# Project Plan for Online Card Games Web Service

## Project Information

- **Project:** Online Card Games Web Service
- **Project Time-frame:** 12 hours from kickoff

## Introduction

In light of recent global events and the resulting shift towards online entertainment, ACME Corp. proposes the development of a minimum viable product (MVP) for an online card games web service. This service will enable users to play card games remotely, with operations such as dealing cards from a deck, returning cards, and shuffling the deck.

## Goals

The goal of this project is to deliver a web service that:

- Deals one card from the top of a deck
- Returns one card to the bottom of the deck
- Shuffles the deck
- Supports concurrent games each with their own decks (Optional Bonus)

## Technical Lead

- **Sponsor:** Castle Rock
- **Manager:** Kristin Virshbo
- **Technical Lead:** Brian Smith

## Methodology

An agile development methodology will be employed, with emphasis on rapid prototyping and iterative feedback. The project will be divided into several short phases:

1. **Requirements Gathering** (1 hour)
2. **Design and Modeling** (2 hours)
3. **Implementation** (6 hours)
4. **Testing** (2 hours)
5. **Deployment and Documentation** (1 hour)

## Work Breakdown Structure

1. **Preparation**
   - Environment setup
   - Tool selection (Spring Boot, Maven, Git)
2. **Inception**
   - Requirements analysis
   - Service architecture design
3. **Construction**
   - Core functionality implementation:
     - Card dealing
     - Card returning
     - Deck shuffling
   - API development for service interaction
4. **Transition**
   - Unit testing and integration testing
   - Packaging (WAR or executable JAR creation)
   - Deployment instructions

## Deliverables

- Source code repository (with complete source code)
- Executable JAR or WAR file
- Build and run instructions
- Basic API documentation

## Risk Management

Given the tight time frame, risks include scope creep and technical challenges with the Spring Boot framework. Risk mitigation strategies include:

- Prioritizing core functionalities
- Preparing fallback plans for technical hurdles

## Planning Checklist

- **Flexibility:** Schedule adjustments may be necessary based on progress.
- **Resources:** Leveraging existing tools and frameworks to minimize setup time.
- **Dependencies:** No external dependencies expected for this MVP.

## Conclusion

This project plan outlines the steps to develop a web service for online card games, addressing the current demand for digital entertainment solutions. By focusing on core functionalities and employing an agile approach, we aim to deliver a functional MVP within the specified 12-hour timeframe.
